## Abstract

With the widespread use of social media, users frequently post content that reflects their personal interests and characteristics. However, many platforms do not provide complete user information or some users may not fully disclose their personal information, such as education level, age, or nationality. In this project, we aim to infer user profiles from social media posts using deep learning techniques. We employ an LSTM model and knowledge graph to predict the demographic data of users, and utilize various training strategies to improve prediction accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves strong performance in predicting both gender and their birth state (United States).
